/*
 * jest-styled-components uses the babel presets preset-env and preset-react.
 * 
 * @babel/preset-env is a smart preset that allows you to use the latest JavaScript without needing
 * to micromanage which syntax transforms (and optionally, browser polyfills) are needed by your
 * target environment(s). This both makes your life easier and JavaScript bundles smaller.
 * 
 * @babel/preset-react includes the following plugins: 
 * 
 * @babel/plugin-syntax-jsx
 * @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx
 * @babel/plugin-transform-react-display-name
 * 
 * and with the development option:
 * 
 * @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx-self
 * @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx-source
 * 
 * @babel/plugin-syntax-jsx is a syntax plugin that lets babel parse jsx.
 *
 * @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx is a transform plugin that takes in jsx and returns vanilla 
 * JavaScript.
 * 
 * @babel/plugin-transform-react-display-name is a transform plugin that provides React objects
 * with their displayName properties that are implicitly set in React. This improves debugging and
 * provides the name of erroring components rather than just displaying "Component".
 *
 * there are two additional plugins included here: @babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread and 
 * @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties .
 * 
 * @babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread adds support for the rest and spread operators, which 
 * are similar but different.
