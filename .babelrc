 * jest-styled-components uses the babel presets preset-env and preset-react.
 * 
 * @babel/preset-env is a smart preset that allows you to use the latest JavaScript without needing
 * to micromanage which syntax transforms (and optionally, browser polyfills) are needed by your
 * target environment(s). This both makes your life easier and JavaScript bundles smaller.
